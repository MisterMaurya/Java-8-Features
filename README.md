## Java 8 New Features:
* #### Concise Code
* #### Enabling Functional Programming
1. Lambda Expressions
2. Functional Interface
3. Default Methods and Static Method
4. Predifined Functional Interfaces
   * Predicate
   * Function
   * Consumer
   * supplier etc.
5. Double Colon Operator (::)
   * Method Reference
   * Constructor Reference
6. Streams
7. Date And Time API
8. Optional class
9. Nashron JavaScript Engine

## 1. Lambda Expressions
* Main Objective of Lambda Expressions to bring benefits of Functional Programming.
  * It is a anonymous function(Nameless)
  * Without Return type
  * Without modifier
## 2. Functional Interface 
* A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method.
## Default Methods and Static Method
* Default Methods In Java 8. Before Java 8, interfaces could have only abstract methods. The implementation of these methods has to be provided in a separate class. So, if a new method is to be added in an interface, then its implementation code has to be provided in the class implementing the same interface.
